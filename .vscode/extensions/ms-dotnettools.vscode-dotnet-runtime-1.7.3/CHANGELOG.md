## [Unreleased]

## [1.7.3] - 2023-08-24

Fixes an issue where install script files could have race conditions by introducing file locking mechanisms.
Adds proxy detection & support that forwards calls through a proxy to axios. This is to fix a bug in axios where it does not handle proxies correctly.
Attempts to discover powershell in more ways in case it's been removed from the PATH, or try using powershell core if only that is available.
Improves file permissions handling to prevent issues on mac and linux where install script files may not have the correct permissions to execute.
Remarks in error messages how users in China may experience timeouts or offline errors due to GFW blocking our download pages.

## [1.7.2] - 2023-08-24

This release completely revamps the web request handling to a new library (axios).

## [1.7.1] - 2023-08-24

This is a small release that changes the error handling and issue reporting experience to make it easier to submit issues with the information we need to properly triage them. It also updates some package dependencies and increases timeout time.

## [1.7.0] - 2023-08-14

This is a small release with a targeted set of fixes derived from user reports in the past week or so.
