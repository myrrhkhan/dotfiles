# Remedy - iTerm 2

> An iTerm 2 profile matching the colours used in VS Code's Remedy theme. üé®

## Installation

- Download the _Remedy - Dark.itermcolors_ or _Remedy - Bright.itermcolors_ file from the [latest release assets][github-releases] on Github or from this directory
- Open (double-click) the downloaded file - it should be imported to iTerm autoamtically
- To activate the colour theme, go to iTerm's _Preferences_ -> _Profiles_ -> _Colors_ -> _Color Presets_ and select _Remedy - Dark_ or _Remedy - Bright_ from the list

If you would like to make iTerm look like in the screenshot, you might want to customise the following settings:

- Font (I use _Operator Mono_ with ligatures hacked into it ü§∑‚Äç)
- Cursor (I'm using _Box_)
- Any other, non-colour-related settings

Enjoy!
