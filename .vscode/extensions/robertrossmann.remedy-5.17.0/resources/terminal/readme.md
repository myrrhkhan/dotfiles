# Remedy - Terminal

> A MacOS Terminal profile matching the colours used in VS Code's Remedy theme. üé®

## Installation

Download the _Remedy - Dark.terminal_ or _Remedy - Bright.terminal_ file from the [latest release assets][github-releases] on Github or from this directory and open it. It will be added to your Terminal's profiles from where you can make this profile the default one - all subsequent Terminal windows will then use this profile.

Since a Terminal profile contains almost all the available settings and not just colours, you will likely want to fix/change the following settings after installation:

- Font (I use _Operator Mono_ with ligatures hacked into it ü§∑‚Äç). You probably won't have the same font installed as I have.
- Cursor
- Any other, non-colour-related settings

Enjoy!
